# E-Voting APP Using BlockChain

This project demonstrates a use case of Hardhat, Node.js, and Solidity for BlockChain to develop an E-Voting Application. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm init
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat init
npm install --save dev "download_required_dependencies"
npx hardhat run --network volta scripts/deploy.js  
node index.js //
```
